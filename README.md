#Travel itinerary planner

I want to build a web app that creates a personalized trip plan/itinerary with trip details where the user is able to create, edit, 
and delete an activity.

##Features
1. Landing page:
 - Calendar and clickable div's to add an event
2. Route for each date on the calendar:
 - search field and button that will request country information
 - below the search bar it will have a section to render the cities of that particular search 
 - each city will have an add button to save it in a database
3. Route for each city:
 - all data of that city
 - nearby attractions and restaurants
 - button to add attraction and restaurant to a table on database

Still planning the rest of the app...
